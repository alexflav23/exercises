rps-api
==============

Simple implementation of a Play web store application that implements a basic product catalogue
with attributes and categories.

Adds an optional plug and play Cassandra powered real database backend. I've added this using my own Cassandra driver
as the inherent familiarity with the driver API made it super easy to be done with it quickly.
